# WindowsSetupScript

## Purpose

This is a script for setting up Windows to how I like it on a fresh install.

## To-Do List
- Add a check to see if scoop is installed already
- Add a check to see if Winget is installed already
- Add call to reopen PowerShell after installing git so that the Scoop Buckets can be added properly :white_check_mark:
- Add check for PowerShell Config Directory Path and create it if it doesn't exist
- Add exit command at end to get out of nested PowerShell :white_check_mark:
